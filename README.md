Felix does CodeForces
=====================

These are my submissions for CodeForces problems. They aren't pretty. They aren't annotated. I wrote these as I'd write them during a competition -- as quickly as I can. The folders represent problemset and files are named by problem letter.

My languages of choice are C++ and Python.

Cheers,

Felix
